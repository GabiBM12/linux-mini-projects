# Linux Mini Projects

A collection of small, practical Linux scripts and notes used in day-to-day cloud engineering work.

## Projects

- [`ssh/`](./ssh) — SSH agent helper + SSH hardening audit scripts

## Standards

- Scripts are written for bash: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Defensive mode: `set -euo pipefail`
- No secrets committed to Git
